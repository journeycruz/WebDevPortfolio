# WebDevPortfolio

## Description

This is the latest and greatest version of my portfolio so far. I have included my most recent project TEAM PLAYER as well as two of my best assignments to showcase for now. Each project has two buttons; One will send you to the browser version of the webpage, and the other will direct you to the Github repository for that project. I have also included social buttons that link to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email. There is an 'About Me' section and my phone number is also listed on the footer of the page. I decided to download all of the library's used this time to test how it would impact load times on my website. In future versions I would like to include a section for my graphic design projects, a section where I explain my proficiency in each programming language, and an email input form that works with php to automate emails sent directly from the footer of the page. I would also like to push myself to learn how to create custom animations to add to the site.
